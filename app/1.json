          "bodyText": "72 min: Halfpenny runs back a long kick and made quite a few yards before being taken down. Anscombe then sends a big kick for Liam Williams to chase and he gets hold of it after some bungling from on the wing as two Australians collide. Sadly for Wales, they could not make the most of being in the 22 and Australia turn it over. 70 min: Jonathan Davies tried to send a ball out to the right but Folau was there to intercept. Then To’omua smashed the ball down the pitch and it went straight out of play beyond the in-goal area, so we’ve come back for a scrum a long way back. 68 min: From a very central position, Halfpenny shows he has recovered from a miserable first-half of kicking to send the ball through the posts to give Wales the lead! 66 min: Foley is off for Australia, with To’omua replacing him. Wales have a lineout in a dangerous position and they manage to work it out from the left to the right, eventually winning a penalty for offside. 64 min: Owens steers the ruck towards the line, along with a number of colleagues but in the end it collapses and Australia get the put-in at a scrum following good work from Hooper. Since the changes the scrum dynamic has changed a bit with Australia looking the stronger in there. The front rows fail to engage and they get a talking to from the ref as they try to work out to scrum. In the end Australia make it all work and clear the ball down the pitch. 62 min: Beale has just pointlessly sent two kicks straight down the middle of the pitch to the Wales backs. And then Wales sent it back twice. In the end Wales try to slip through a grubber to chase but Genia read it well and removed any immediate danger. 60 min: So many mistakes! Wales broke through the ranks, with Adams being taken down but Tomos Williams was straight in to reclaim it but only succeeded in knocking on. Oh well ... Kepu and Simmon are also on for Australia, as Jenkins enters the fray for Wales. 58 min: The changes for Australia have made a instant impact in winning a scrum. That could be a gamechanger. The replacements have reinvigorated the Wallabies who looked dangerous until Hooper forgot to catch the ball and succumbed to a knock-on. Tomos Williams is on at scrum-half for Wales, too. 56 min: Another failed lineout from Australia results in Wales clearing the ball long down the pitch, followed by a stunning chase. In the end, the pressure on Australia shows as Wales gain a turnover. Wales bring on Rob Evans",
